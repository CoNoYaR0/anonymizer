    You are an expert HR data analyst. Your task is to refine and complete the extraction of data from a CV.

    Here is the raw text from the CV:
    --- RAW TEXT ---
    {raw_text}
    --- END RAW TEXT ---

    Here is a first-pass extraction done by a less advanced system:
    --- INITIAL JSON ---
    {json.dumps(initial_extraction, indent=2)}
    --- END INITIAL JSON ---

    Please refine this data. Correct any spelling mistakes or OCR errors in the JSON fields by cross-referencing the raw text.
    Then, carefully parse the raw text to extract the 'experience' and 'skills' sections, which are currently missing.

    Return ONLY a single, clean, and complete JSON object with the final, corrected data. Do not add any commentary before or after the JSON.
